# LEGO-Mod

A custom mod version of the Lego micro game provided by Unity. 
I left the game incomplete and moved on so it's just a single level game for now.


## To play:
- Download the **Lego.Mod.zip** file from the releases section
- Extract the zip file to your preferred directory
- Inside the folder, run the **Lego.exe** file to play the game
