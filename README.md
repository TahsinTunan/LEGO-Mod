# LEGO-Mod

A custom mod version of the Lego micro game provided by Unity. 
I left the game incomplete and moved on so it's just a single level game for now.


## To play:
- Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/tahsintunan/LEGO-Mod/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- Extract the zip file to your preferred directory
- Inside the folder, run **Lego.exe** to play the game
